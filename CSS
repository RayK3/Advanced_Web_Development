Pseudo-Classes
  Allow you to specify the style of an element when its in a specific state. 
  Syntax:
    selector:pseudo-class {
      property: value;
    }
  Specifically:
  hover, focus, active
  
  :hover
    Matches any selector that is currently in the hover state. 
    ex: 
      h1:hover {
        background-color: pink;
      }
  
  :focus
    The focus pseudo-class represents an element such as a form input that has received focus. 
    It is generally triggered when the user clicks or taps on an element or selects it with 
    the keyboard's tab key
   
  :active
    Triggers when an element is "being activated by user"
    This normally seems like when the element is pressed and held. 
    
  A few CSS styles:
    - box-shadow: gives a shadow in the specified position.
    - top: 2px; This would make the element move down 2px if the position is relative. 
    
CSS Transforms 
  This lets you move, warp, rotate, and scale elements. They will overwrite eachother if
  you write one after the other. In order to do both, you need to chain them. 
  
  Translation:
  ex:
    transform: translateX(100px); moves 100px to the right
    transform: translateY(100px); moves 100px down
    transform: translate(20px, 20px); moves down and to the right 20px 
  
  Scaling:
  ex:
    transform: scale(3); makes the element 3 times larger. 
    transform: scale(3, 2); makes it 3 times longer in x, 2 in y. 
    
    transform: scaleX(3); makes the element 3 times longer in the x.
    transform: scaleY(3); makes the element 3 times longer in the y.
    
  Every aspect of the element will be scaled, including border-sizes etc. The element is by 
  default scaled from its center.
  
  Transform Origin: This changes where the origin property of the element is measured. 
    - can give it 2 numbers corresponding to x and y, or just 'left', 'right', 'center'
    to place the origin in these locations. 
    
  Rotations
    Using CSS to...rotate things
    If the deg is positive, it will turn clockwise, if it is negative, it will turn counter-clockwise. 
    
Vendor Prefixes:
  These are the -moz- and -webkit- that you have put in front of some styles. 
  ***There are tons of auto-prefixers. Just search up css auto-prefixer
    
    
Transitions:
  4 Transition Properties:
    - transition-duration
    - transition-property
    - transition-timing-function 
    - transition-delay 
    
  Transition-duration: takes one or more values in seconds, and applies the transition(s) over this time
  Transition-property: if present, only transforms the properties that are explicitly stated. Or you can say all for all.
