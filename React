JSX with React
  - when declaring a class inside jsx, you use className instead of class because babel
  can't tell if you mean a javascript class or an html class. 
  
  Adding Styles programmatically through javascript
  - style always is represented as a JS object, so you use camelcasing and ''.
  
For any javascript within JSX, you can just put it in curly brackets. 

Create React App
  - A tool that allows you to get an up and running react app with minimal effort
  - uses Webpack
  
  Webpack:
    - A module bundler for modern JavaScript applications
    - Combines different JS files into a bundle.js
    
History
  - Allows you to go backwards and forwards in the browsers history. 
  - You can change the url address bar
  - You can change the browser's local navigation history
  - THIS DOES NOT cause the browser to make a new GET request
  
BrowserRouter
  - In order to use any routing, you need to wrap your highest-level component in a Router
  tag
  
Link Component
  - Essentially just an anchor tag, but instead when you click that link, ReactRouter will take
  over and use the history object to change the url
  
NavLink Component
  - has a prop that is activeStyle, which is a style object that will only be rendered when you 
  are on that path. 
  - also has a defaultStyle that will be displayed when not active.
  
URL Parameters
  - Can add a paramter in the url by using :parameterName which will be accessible by using 
  match.params.name
  
Route Props
  - A Route component will be on every page, except it only renders if the url matches the path                       
  - A component inside of a Route gets 3 props
  
  match - info about how the url matches the route component
  location - where you are now, similar to window.location
  history - similar to html5 history object, allows explicit changes to the url
    - These are only available when their component is rendered within a route component
    
withRouter
  - If a component is not rendered inside of a Route component, you can use withRouter to get route props
  
Route Render prop:
  - allows you to declare inline what to render when on that route
  ex:
    <Route path="/teachers" render={props => (
      <Teachers {...props} teachers={teachers} />
    )}/> 
    // This allows teachers to get all of the props from the route, and its own props.
