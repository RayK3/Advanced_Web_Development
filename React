JSX with React
  - when declaring a class inside jsx, you use className instead of class because babel
  can't tell if you mean a javascript class or an html class. 
  
  Adding Styles programmatically through javascript
  - style always is represented as a JS object, so you use camelcasing and ''.
  
For any javascript within JSX, you can just put it in curly brackets. 

Props
  - How data is passed down the component tree

Default Props
  - is a static method, and it gives default values for props in a component
  ex:
  
    (inside the class)
    
    static defaultProps = {
      ingredients: []
    }
    
    (outside the class)
    
    ingredientList.defaultProps = {
      ingredients: []
    };
    
props.children
  - A collection of the children inside of a component 
    
PropTypes
  - Development time type checker for your props (only works when the app is in development)
  
  
State
  - Data in our application that can change 
  - state is normally defined in the constructor. It is just a normal object 
  - Changes to state should be pure
setState
  - The correct way to change state in your application
  - this.setState lives in the component. It can either take an object that will just overwrite the state 
  that is previously saved, or you can pass it a function that has a reference to the currentState which
  you can add to. 
  
Component Architecture
  - State is always passed from a parent down to a child component as a prop
  
Pure Functions
  - A function with no side effects
  - it does not modify its inputs
  - it is repeatable. Same input = same output

Create React App
  - A tool that allows you to get an up and running react app with minimal effort
  - uses Webpack
  
  Webpack:
    - A module bundler for modern JavaScript applications
    - Combines different JS files into a bundle.js
    
History
  - Allows you to go backwards and forwards in the browsers history. 
  - You can change the url address bar
  - You can change the browser's local navigation history
  - THIS DOES NOT cause the browser to make a new GET request
  
BrowserRouter
  - In order to use any routing, you need to wrap your highest-level component in a Router
  tag
  
Link Component
  - Essentially just an anchor tag, but instead when you click that link, ReactRouter will take
  over and use the history object to change the url
  
NavLink Component
  - has a prop that is activeStyle, which is a style object that will only be rendered when you 
  are on that path. 
  - also has a defaultStyle that will be displayed when not active.
  
URL Parameters
  - Can add a paramter in the url by using :parameterName which will be accessible by using 
  match.params.name
  
Route Props
  - A Route component will be on every page, except it only renders if the url matches the path                       
  - A component inside of a Route gets 3 props
  
  match - info about how the url matches the route component
  location - where you are now, similar to window.location
  history - similar to html5 history object, allows explicit changes to the url
    - These are only available when their component is rendered within a route component
    
withRouter
  - If a component is not rendered inside of a Route component, you can use withRouter to get route props
  
Route Render prop:
  - allows you to declare inline what to render when on that route
  ex:
    <Route path="/teachers" render={props => (
      <Teachers {...props} teachers={teachers} />
    )}/> 
    // This allows teachers to get all of the props from the route, and its own props.
    
State
  - State is always passed from a parent down to a child component as a prop
  - State should not be passed to a sibling or a parent
  - State should be owned by one component 
  
  setState() 
    - setState that depends on previous state.
    - If you need it to depend on a previous state, then it is much easier to just use an update function
    
    ex:
      this.setState((prevState, props) => {
        return {
          counter: prevState.counter + 1
        };
      });
      
    -setState is Asynchronous
    
    *- SetState can take an optional second parameter that is a callback function that will trigger as soon
    as the state is updated. (if you want to console.log something, this is the place to do it)
    
    - Just look at this:
    const NUM_BOXES = 32;
    const boxes = Array(NUM_BOXES).fill().map(this.getRandomColor, this);
    
    - an example of a stateless functional component that takes props
    const Box = ({color}) => {               // this is grabbing the color property from the props object
      const style = {
        width: '180px',
        height: '180px',
        display: 'inline-block',
        backgroundColor: color
      }
      return <div style={style} />;
    }
    
    - when using an arrow function callback, 'this' is taken from the surrounding environment 
    
The Virtual Dom
  - A data structure stored by React that tracks changes from one render state to the next
  
Synthetic Events
  - Supports all the native browser events, but provides a consistent API on all browsers
  
  - You should add any events directly to the elements JSX directly when it is being rendered.
    - Like an onClick={} property on a button 
    
Forms
  Uncontrolled Component
    A component where the state is controlled by the browser, not react
    ex: <input type="text" />
    
  Controlled Component
    A component where react controls the state
    ex: 
    <input
      type="text"
      name="inputText"
      value={this.state.inputText}
      onChange={(e) => {                             // whenever you enter text, the state will be reset
        this.setState({inputText: e.target.value})
      }}
    />  
    
  Form onSubmit method
  ex:
  <form onSubmit={(e) => {
    e.preventDefault();        // prevents a new http request from being fired to the server
    const data = [...this.state.data, this.state.inputText];
    this.setState({data, inputText: ''});
  }}>
  
  You should always use onSubmit, not an onClick event on a submit button. 
  
refs
  - A direct reference to a DOM element 
  - WARNING: don't use refs when you can do the same jobs in React. 
  
Component Lifecycle Methods
  - Mounting Methods:
    constructor() - when the constructor is called
    componentWillMount() -
